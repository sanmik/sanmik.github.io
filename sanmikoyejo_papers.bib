  abstract = {This dissertation addresses probabilistic inference via relative entropy
	minimization subject to expectation constraints. A canonical representation
	of the solution is determined without the requirement for convexity
	of the constraint set, and is given by members of an exponential
	family. The use of conjugate priors for relative entropy minimization
	is proposed, and a class of conjugate prior distributions is introduced.
	An alternative representation of the solution is provided as members
	of the prior family when the prior distribution is conjugate. It
	is shown that the solutions can be found by direct optimization with
	respect to members of such parametric families. Constrained Bayesian
	inference is recovered as a special case with a specific choice of
	constraints induced by observed data. The framework is applied to
	the development of novel probabilistic models for multitask learning
	subject to constraints determined by domain expertise. First, a model
	is developed for multitask learning that jointly learns a low rank
	weight matrix and the prior covariance structure between different
	tasks. The multitask learning approach is extended to a class of
	nonparametric statistical models for transposable data, incorporating
	side information such as graphs that describe inter-row and inter-column
	similarity. The resulting model combines a matrix-variate Gaussian
	process prior with inference subject to nuclear norm expectation
	constraints. In addition, a novel nonparametric model is proposed
	for multitask bipartite ranking. The proposed model combines a hierarchical
	matrix-variate Gaussian process prior with inference subject to ordering
	constraints and nuclear norm constraints, and is applied to disease
	gene prioritization. In many of these applications, the solution
	is found to be unique. Experimental results show substantial performance
	improvements as compared to strong baseline models.},
